# Logistic Regression project

## A working example of how logistic regression can be applied to prevent attrition of employees in a company.

## Problem:
A company is faced with incessant attrition of employees despite huge intakes during every onboarding. About 14000 employees find seat in the company after every employment. But for each year, about 15% of the intakes leave the company: either due to withdrawal or by sacking. This always pose challenges on the company since gaps needing filling are created; new employees are to be employed and allowed to acclimatize; and it speaks ill of the company. The preceeding scenario led to the employment of HR analytics team to curb and improve the number of working years of employees in the company. 


## Objective:
For this project, as a Data scientist, I am required to train and test a Logistic regression model with the available dataset from the company to determine factors leading to attrition of employees. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

## Steps employed:
* Import the required libraries.
The libraries needed for the project are import, such as: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Seaborn.
* load dataset.
The csv data set 'general_data.csv' is here, loaded from the source to the notebook with the help of Pandas library.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To understand and recognize pattern in the data I employed this process. The dimension, information, spotting of missing values, shape, correlation and visual assessment of the dataset was carried out.
* Data wrangling.
For a better model performance the dataset was cleared of null values, categorical features were encoded, feature selection and scaling were done.
* Data Training and Testing.
The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
* Accuracy Check.

## Model Accuracy
After working on the project, an accuracy score of 84% was actualized, meaning that the model is good and effective in handling prevention of attrition to a very large extent for the company.
