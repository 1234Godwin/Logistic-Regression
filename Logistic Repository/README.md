# Logistic Regression project

## A working example of how logistic regression can be applied to prevent attrition of employees in a company.

## Problem:
A company is faced with incessant attrition of employees despite huge intakes during every onboarding. About 14000 employees find seat in the company after every employment. But for each year, about 15% of the intakes leave the company: either due to withdrawal or by sacking. This always pose challenges on the company since gaps needing filling are created; new employees are to be employed and allowed to acclimatize; and it speaks ill of the company. The preceeding scenario led to the employment of HR analytics team to curb and improve the number of working years of employees in the company. 


## Objective:
For this project, as a Data scientist, I am required to train and test a Logistic regression model with the available dataset from the company to determine factors leading to attrition of employees. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

## Steps employed:
* Import the required libraries.
* load dataset.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data wrangling.
* Data Training and Testing.
* Accuracy Check.

## Model Accuracy
After working on the project, an accuracy score of 73% was actualized, meaning that the model is good and effective in handling prevention of attrition to a very large extent for the company.
